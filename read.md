"Improve Home Air Quality: 5 Ways///1. Air Purifiers: *Invest in a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air purifier. *Choose a purifier with an activated carbon filter to remove odors and gases. *Place the purifier in your most frequently used room, such as the bedroom or living room. *Run the purifier continuously, or at least for several hours a day. *Clean or replace the filters regularly, according to the manufacturer's instructions. *Quantify: Aim for a purifier with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) appropriate for the size of your room.///2. Ventilation: *Open windows and doors for short periods, even in cold weather, to allow fresh air to circulate. *Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathrooms to remove pollutants generated during cooking and showering. *Ensure proper ventilation in your home by checking for and clearing any blockages in vents. *Consider installing a whole-house ventilation system for continuous fresh air supply. *Quantify: Aim for at least 15-20 minutes of ventilation per day.///3. Plants: *Certain houseplants can help filter indoor air pollutants. *Choose plants like snake plants (Sansevieria trifasciata), spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum), and pothos (Epipremnum aureum). *Place plants strategically throughout your home, especially in areas where you spend the most time. *Maintain the plants properly by watering them regularly and wiping down their leaves to remove dust. *Quantify: Aim for at least one plant per 100 square feet of space. For a home with 1000 sq ft, you can use 10 snake plants, 10 spider plants and 10 pothos.///4. Cleaning: *Regularly dust and vacuum your home to remove dust mites, pet dander, and other allergens. *Use a damp cloth to dust surfaces to prevent dust from becoming airborne. *Wash bedding and curtains frequently to remove dust and allergens. *Consider using a HEPA filter vacuum cleaner to trap fine particles. *Quantify: Aim to dust and vacuum at least once a week.///5. Reduce Pollutant Sources: *Avoid smoking indoors. *Use low-VOC or VOC-free cleaning products and paints. *Minimize the use of air fresheners, scented candles, and other products that release volatile organic compounds (VOCs). *Store chemicals and paints in a well-ventilated area, away from living spaces. *Quantify: Switch to eco-friendly cleaning products and paints, and limit the use of fragranced products."
